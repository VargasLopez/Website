                    <p class="pub-abstract">
                        Dishonesty harms economic performance and growth.
                        However, the literature on dishonesty has used almost exclusively samples from developed
                        countries.
                        In addition, previous studies present non-conclusive results on how concerns for others affect
                        lying behaviour.
                        In view of this gap in the evidence, the present study explores how the decision to be dishonest
                        changes when it affects a charity.
                        In an experiment involving 555 participants in Mexico, subjects could lie about the result of a
                        dice roll without any possibility of detection.
                        We contrast a situation without incentives to three conditions that differ in how dishonesty
                        affected the charity.
                        Deceitful behaviour increased when participants could benefit from it.
                        Also, participants lied less when they received benefits at the expense of the charity, but they
                        did not lie more when they could help it.
                        Our results suggest that making salient how dishonesty harms others might help reduce its
                        negative effects in society.

                    <p class="pub-meta"><span class="journal">Q Open</span>, 2023</p>
                    <p class="pub-authors">Adrian Vargas-Lopez, <span class="co-authors">Ann-Kathrin Koessler</span></p>
                    <p class="pub-abstract">
                        With the advent of climate change, extreme weather events have become increasingly frequent and
                        intense, posing significant challenges to agricultural systems worldwide.
                        Farmers are among the most vulnerable groups, whose livelihoods depend heavily on
                        weather-sensitive crops.
                        In this paper, we assess whether farmers adapt or maladapt after being exposed to extreme
                        weather events and whether their perceived well-being determines their decisions.
                        By analysing data about the farming practices and conditions of 970 farmers in Thailand, we
                        examine the actions farmers implement, which can be catalogued as adaptation or maladaptation
                        actions.
                        Although our results cannot specify an increase in adaptation or maladaptation actions after
                        experiencing an extreme weather event, we reveal a notable rise in maladaptation with state aid
                        for natural disasters.
                        Similarly, we find that risk tolerance correlates with increased adaptation, while higher
                        patience offsets this effect.

                        The United Nations Social Development Goals ensure the achievement of food security by 2030.
                        Food security is characterized by various aspects, however in this study we focus on economic
                        vulnerability to food insecurity.
                        In particular, we compared two measures: food insecurity levels as defined by the Integrated
                        food security phase classification Global-Partners quantitative scale and those defined by the
                        Latin American and Caribbean Food Security qualitative scale.
                        The qualitative scale only measures nutritional status using specific questions, regardless of
                        food expenditures, while the quantitative scale is based on the share of consumer expenditure
                        spent on food (the ratio between food expenditure and total expenditure).
                        From our analysis on 2018 Mexico data—therefore unaffected by the pandemic—59% of discrepancies
                        were found between the two measures.
                        The qualitative scale does not classify people who spend too much on food as being food
                        insecure, so they are economically vulnerable about housing, healthcare and other important
                        aspects of social life (access to food generate insecurity).
                        The quantitative scale does not identify people who do not have access to high-quality nutrition
                        because they must pay for other fixed expenses, for example for housing or healthcare.
                        These two measures depict two aspects of economic vulnerability to food insecurity, and here we
                        quantify this difference in a developing country.
                        Future research should be at integrating these two aspects into one single indicator based on
                        food and non-food expenditures, so to take into account both the two aspects by using only
                        consumption expenditure data.

                        In this study, we apply the Theory of Planned Behavior to understand the factors that explained
                        adherence to health recommendations during the first wave of Covid-19 in Mexico City.
                        To do this, we designed and implemented an online survey on prevention measures.
                        In addition, we generate an empirical correlate of the Theory of Planned Behavior to hypothesize
                        about correlations between variables in the survey.
                        In addition, we included four simple experiments in the survey. We found that norms, attitudes
                        and perception of control are correlated with the planning and adoption of preventive actions.
                        In the experiments we observe (1) that corruption reduces the credibility of the government with
                        respect to the health crisis, (2) doctors are more persuasive about prevention, and (3) masks
                        generate feelings of security.
                        We conclude that the Theory of Planned Behavior is useful to make sense of data from surveys
                        like ours.
                        We encourage governments in developing countries to use methods like ours to collect and
                        interpret data, even if provisional, to respond to future health crises.

                        Household food waste is driven by consumer habits and behaviors.
                        The necessary measures implemented during the lockdown worldwide to contain the Covid-19
                        pandemic altered these consumer practices.
                        This paper examines how household's culinary traditions and food management have changed in
                        Mexico as a result of Covid-related restrictions, and their impact on food waste.
                        We obtained 525 answers using an online survey about food habits distributed through social
                        networks in Mexico between December 2020 and January 2021.
                        The results show that the participating households increased their monetary expenditure on
                        groceries and reduced food waste during the pandemic.
                        The estimation of consumer responsiveness to waste, through the introduction of a framework
                        based on a Quadratic Almost-Ideal Demand System, confirms that, even more during the lockdown,
                        food waste has become a luxury good.
                        The analysis of food category changes allows for a detailed study useful to curtail the level of
                        food waste in Mexican households and to encourage transition towards sustainable and circular
                        consumption behaviors.
